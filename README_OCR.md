# OCR Usage Instructions

## Current Issue
The OCR is working correctly but detecting the main game interface instead of inventory items.

## To Fix
1. Open your **inventory window** in New World (press TAB)
2. Make sure crafting materials are visible (ingots, ores, cloth, leather, wood, etc.)
3. Take a screenshot of the inventory window
4. Replace image.png with the inventory screenshot
5. Run the OCR script again

## What the OCR looks for
- Prismatic materials (Ingot, Cloth, Leather, Planks)
- Refined materials (Asmodeum, Steel Ingot, Silk, etc.)
- Raw materials (Ores, Hides, Wood, Fibers)
- Reagents (Flux, Tannin, Sandpaper)
